# IMPORT AND MODULES
Modules refer to a file containing python stattements and definitions.We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files.    
In this project, There are answers to exercies that are meant to help understand importing and using functions and creating modules in Python.    
Including builtin functions like dir() - which shows the number of names got from all modules or a specific module if called with an arumentd. The other files include answers to exercies on command line arguments within Python programs.    

## Tasks  
| Filename | Description |  
| -------- | ----------- |  
| [0-add.py](./0-add.py): |  imports the function def add(a, b): from the file *[add_0.py](./0-add.py): and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3 |
| [1-calculation.py](./1-calculation.py): | that imports functions from the file, does some Maths, and prints the result |  
| [2-args.py](./2-args.py): | prints the number of and the list of its arguments.|

| [5-variable_load.py](.5-variable_load.py): |  imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value. |  
| [100-my_calculator.py](./100-my_calculator.py): |  imports all functions from the file calculator_1.py and handles basic operations. |
| [101-easy_print.py](./101-easy_print.py): | prints #pythoniscool, followed by a new line, in the standard output. |
